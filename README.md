# Fluidsim in Godot 4 with MLS-MPM and SSFR

This is an implementation of Moving Least Squares Material Method for a fluid simulation.

I wanted it to look good so I added some parts of Screen-Space Fluid Rendering.

I used the guide to MPM by niall t.l. as a starting point: https://nialltl.neocities.org/articles/mpm_guide  

There are still many ways to improve this, including some ideas from this article I used: https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/02/26/webgpu-fluid-simulations-high-performance-real-time-rendering/
